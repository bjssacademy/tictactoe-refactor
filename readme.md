# TicTacToe Refactor

Here we have a simple game to TicTacToe - or noughts and crosses if you are in the UK. Whilst the code works, it suffers from a few issues:

1. Tightly coupled to the console for display
2. Absolutely no tests whatsoever
3. The use of enums
4. Lack of separation of concerns
5. A 1D array trying to represent a 2D structure
6. And many others...

Refactor the code provided to make it simpler to test and maintain.
